## Week 4 assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data: Code book

### My understanding of the original data

The data originally comes from Reyes-Ortis et al. I append their original codebooks (README.txt and features_info.txt).

I believe their experiment was essentially the following:
Attach a smartphone to 30 volunteers ("subject"s).
Have them do one of six "activities" for a given period of time (a few minutes I guess, but I'm not sure).
During that time, the smartphone records acceleration and gyroscopic raw data

Reyes-Ortis et al took that raw data, manipulated it in various ways (which I don't understand) and calculated various statistics on it.  These manipulations, together with the stats they calculated, comprised their so-called "feature" vector (being what we would call the variables).

They divided their data up between "training" data and "test" data.  I assume they were working on an algorithm that uses real-time smartphone measurements to figure out what sort of activity the person is doing, but I don't really know.

###  My modifications to the data per the assignment specs

For this assignment, we were asked to merge the test and training data into a single data set.

We then extracted a subset of the "feature" variables, being those related to "mean" and "std" stats.  (I only kept those "feature"s that ended in "-mean()" or "-std()".  There were a handful of additional "feature"s that ended in "Mean", but they seemed somehow different, so I didn't include those in my data.)

We then had a time-history of these "feature"s, per "subject", per "activity".  We were then asked to average the "feature" values over the time-history, so that each "subject"/"activity" pair had an average value for each "feature".  (At least, that's how I understood the assignment.)

###  The columns in my data set

- "activity" -- One of six activities that the subjects were asked to do (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

- "subject" -- The id of the volunteer subject (1-30).

- "tBodyAcc-mean()-X-timeAve" -- The time average of the "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" variable from the original analysis.

 - Etc.

There are 66 measurement variables in total.  For each of the following (there are 33 here, since XYZ represents three variables):

tBodyAcc-XYZ  
tGravityAcc-XYZ    
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ    
tBodyGyro-XYZ  
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
tBodyAccMag  
tGravityAccMag  
tBodyAccJerkMag  
tBodyGyroMag  
tBodyGyroJerkMag  
fBodyAcc-XYZ  
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
fBodyGyro-XYZ  
fBodyAccMag  
fBodyAccJerkMag  
fBodyGyroMag  
fBodyGyroJerkMag  

there is a "-mean()" and a "-std()".
To the end of the variable names I appended "-timeAve" to indicate that I took the averages across time for the variables.

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.


The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

### Following is the original features_info.txt:
Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
